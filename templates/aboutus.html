                <h2>Purpose:</h2>
                <h6>The COVID-19 Clinical Trials Dashboard was designed to give physicians and individuals a way to find COVID-19 trial information in a timely manner.  We include an interactive map of the world that marks the locations of the different clincal trials.   
                    
                    Zooming in on an area of the map brings up the specific locations. Clicking on one of these points, marked by a virus icon, brings up key information about the trial, including contact information.
                    
                    Other visualizations are provided that analyze aspects of the clinical trials.

                    We explored developing a questionnaire that would be used to ask pertinent medical data from individuals that would then be used to direct them to clinical trials that they would be likely to be eligible to participate in.  In the background, machine learning would be used to match the provided medical information with the trials.  

                    No PCI data is collected or stored since we do not ask for personal identification information.

                <h2>Interactive Geographical Map: </h2>

                <h6>Our data was pulled from the website http://clinicaltrials.gov via the provided API, cleaned using a python script with pandas, and then nserted into a SQLite Database.

                    The python script interacts with the Clinical Trials dataset, to handle a second API call using mapquestâ€™s open API to gather coordinate points for each unique location in the database.
                    
                    The dataset is served to the user with a Flask app.  The map was built with Leaflet because of ability to provide interactivity. The dataset was further handled with Javascript to prepare it for mapping.

                <h6> We provide two other visualizations of the clinical trial data.  The JQuery Accordion enables the interactivity of switching between the two graphs, which were built using Plotly.A bar chart shows the number of COVID-19 clinical trials per country. A pie chart shows the number of COVID-19 cliical trials per phase.

                <h2>Machine Learning:</h2>
                <h6>
                    Two medical studies were used as references: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110331 , "A Machine Learning Approach to Identify Clinical Trials Involving Nanodrugs and Nanodevices from ClinicalTrials.gov", and 
                    "Learning Eligibility in Cancer Clinical Trials Using Deep Neural Network" from the MDPI Journal for Applied Sciences. These two studies gave us the idea of using eligibility and exclusiion criteria in our machine learning effort.
                    We decided to limit the scope of the project to those trials that involved drugs as interventions, and to further limit our data set to 5 the five drugs that are currently seen to show the most promise: Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and chloroquine (Aralen), Remdesivir, Favilavir, Lopinavir-ritonavir, Convalescent plasma.
                    
                    Machine Learning in practice involves five key steps: 1)Get the data, 2) Clean, prepare, and manipulate the data, 3) Train the model, 4) Test the data, and 5) Improve.

                    <br><br>
                    <img src="../images/ml_steps.png">
                    <br><br>

                    We pulled the eligibility and exclusion criteria from the current set of clinical trials that contained these drugs in the clinical trial description and loaded them into the database.
                    We prepared the data using pandas to remove extra words and created a csv file of lines of eligibility and exclusion criteris. 

                    We experimented with several machine learning models - Latent Dirichlet, Random Forest, Bag of Words and others until finally choosing Categorical Embedder, described in this article: "Categorical Embedder: Encoding Categorical Variables via Neural Networks" at https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/categorical-embedder-encoding-categorical-variables-via-neural-networks-b482afb1409d . 
                    With Categorical Embedding we were able to create a real very integer number encoding.  Below is sample output of that process.
                    
                    In neural networks, a hidden layer is located between the input and output of the algorithm, in which the function applies weights to the inputs and directs them through an activation function as the output. 
                    In short, the hidden layers perform nonlinear transformations of the inputs entered into the network.
                    
                    We created a test group and trained the neural network.  Below is our resulting output:


                    
            <div class=""></div><div class=""></div>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Our end goal was to create a simple questionnaire to collect responses that could be used to identify appropriate trials.
