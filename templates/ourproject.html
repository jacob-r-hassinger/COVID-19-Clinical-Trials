    <h2>About the COVID-19 Clinical Trials Project</h2>
    <p>
      The COVID-19 Clinical Trials Project was designed to give physicians and individuals a way to find COVID-19 trial
      information in a timely manner.
      We include an interactive map of the world that marks the locations of the different clincal trials and other
      clinical trial visualizations.
      We continued our work by exploring the use of machine learning to help identify appropriate clinical trials for an
      individual.

    </p>
    <h4>The Clinical Trials Map</h4>
    <p>
      Our data was pulled from the clinicaltrials.gov website via the provided API, cleaned using a python script with
      pandas, and then inserted into a SQLite Database.
      The python script interacts with the Clinical Trials dataset, to handle a second API call using mapquestâ€™s open
      API to gather coordinate points for each unique location in the database.
      The dataset is served to the user with a Flask app.
      The dataset was further manipulated with Javascript to prepare it for mapping.

      The interactive map of the world that marks the locations of the different clincal trials.
      The map was built with Leaflet because of ability to provide interactivity.
      Zooming in on an area of the map brings up the specific locations.
      Clicking on one of these points, marked by a virus icon, brings up key information about the trial, including
      contact information.
      Other visualizations are provided that analyze aspects of the clinical trials.

      We provide two other visualizations of the clinical trial data.
      The JQuery Accordion enables the interactivity of switching between the two graphs, which were built using Plotly.
      As you click on a specific clinical trial location, a chart below is filled in with further details about the
      trial.
      A bar chart shows the number of COVID-19 clinical trials per country.
      A pie chart shows the number of COVID-19 cliical trials per phase.


    </p>
    <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>
      Machine Learning in practice involves five key steps: 1)Get the data, 2) Clean, prepare, and manipulate the data,
      3) Train the model, 4) Test the data, and 5) Improve.
      An exhaustive litereature research gave us the idea of using eligibility and exclusiion criteria in our machine
      learning effort.
      We decided to limit the scope of the project to those trials that involved drugs as interventions, and to further
      limit our data set to 5 the five drugs that are currently seen to show the most promise:
      Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and chloroquine (Aralen), Remdesivir, Favilavir, Lopinavir-ritonavir, Convalescent
      plasma.

      We pulled the eligibility and exclusion criteria from the current set of clinical trials that contained these
      drugs in the clinical trial description and loaded them into the database.
      We prepared the data using pandas to remove extra words and created a csv file of lines of eligibility and
      exclusion criteris.
      We experimented with several data preparation methods including - Latent Dirichlet, Bag of Words and others until
      finally choosing Categorical Embedding.
      With Categorical Embedding we were able to create a real very integer number encoding.
      With neural networks, a hidden layer is located between the input and output of the algorithm, in which the
      function applies weights to the inputs and directs them through an activation function as the output.
      In short, the hidden layers perform nonlinear transformations of the inputs entered into the network. Our model
      used two hidden layers.
      We created a test group and trained the neural network. We then did a test and created a variety of visualizations
      of the output.

    </p>
    <h4>Future Work</h4>
    <p>

      A future project could be to create simple questionnaire to collect physical and medical responses from any
      anonymous individual that could be used to identify appropriate trials using the eligibility and elimination
      criteria built into our machine learning model.
