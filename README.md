# COVID-19-Clinical-Trials
The COVID-19 Clinical Trials Project was designed to give physicians and individuals a way to find COVID-19 trial information in a timely manner. We include an interactive map of the world that marks the locations of the different clincal trials and other clinical trial visualizations. We continued our work by exploring the use of machine learning to help identify appropriate clinical trials for an individual.
