In addition, a large, real-world data registry can provide information about how different concomitant medications may differentially affect symptoms among patient subgroups. Such information can be invaluable for clinicians managing chronic diseases during this pandemic, as well as identify interventions undertaken in a naturalistic setting that have differential effects. Such factors may include patient diet, over the counter or prescription medications, and herbal and alternative treatments, among others. Identifying the natural disease history in patients from different demographic and disease subgroups will be important for identifying at-risk patients and effectiveness of interventions undertaken in the community.\n\nObjectives: The purpose of this study is to understand at the population level the symptomatic course of known or suspected COVID-19 patients while sheltering-in-place or under quarantine. Symptoms will be measured using a daily report derived from the CTCAE-PRO as well as free response.

When used properly, these irrigations are a safe and easy intervention available over the counter without a prescription. Additionally, baby shampoo has been found to be a safe additive functioning as a surfactant when a small amount is added to the saline rinses which may help augment clearance of the sinonasal cavity.\n\nWhile many systemic medications and treatments have been proposed for COVID-19, there has not yet been a study looking at targeted local intervention to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx where the viral load is the highest. Studies have shown that the use of simple over the counter nasal saline irrigations can decrease viral shedding in the setting of viral URIs, including the common coronavirus (not SARS-CoV-2). Further, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, mild-detergent application with nasal saline would neutralize the virus further. It is our hypothesis that nasal saline or nasal saline with baby shampoo irrigations may decrease viral shedding\/viral load and viral transmission, secondary bacterial load, nasopharyngeal inflammation in patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2.","32":"Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized into treatment vs control group.

Healthcare providers are tasked with limiting the use of personal protective equipment while minimizing unnecessary exposures to the virus. Results from real-time PCR tests to detect active COVID-19 infections may not be available in a timely fashion during emergent trauma assessments. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a rapidly expanding body of literature has identified a pattern of imaged lung abnormalities with CT and ultrasound (US) characteristic of an active viral infection. US evaluation provides a reliable, portable, and reproducible way of evaluating acute patients in a real time setting. During initial trauma evaluations, patients may also receive adjunct imaging modalities like the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam designed to discover life threatening findings that may require urgent interventions. We therefore propose a study expanding on the current FAST adjunct evaluation in the trauma bay that may include lung parenchyma imaging at the initial assessment to help stratify patients into low or high-risk groups for active COVID-19 infections.

The investigators hypothesize that BCG vaccination can reduce HCW infection and disease severity during the epidemic phase of SARS-CoV-2.","85":"Study KIN-1901-2001 is a multi-center, adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of gimsilumab in subjects with lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","86":"The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of helmet NIV in reducing the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in order to minimize ventilator needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","87":"Study Objective:\n\nTo test if post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease after known exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.\nTo test if early preemptive hydroxychloroquine therapy can prevent disease progression in persons with known symptomatic COVID-19 disease, decreasing hospitalizations and symptom severity.","88":"Phase 2:\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sarilumab relative to the control arm in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 regardless of severity strata.\n\nPhase 3:\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sarilumab relative to the control arm in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (severe and critical).","89":"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 remdesivir (RDV) regimens with respect to clinical status assessed by a 7-point ordinal scale on Day 14.","90":"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 remdesivir (RDV) regimens compared to standard of care (SOC), with respect to clinical status assessed by a 7-point ordinal scale on Day 11.","91":"This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab (TCZ) compared with a matching placebo in combination with standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","92":"ORCHID is a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 75 sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards of supportive care may evolve\/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized subjects. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged subjects will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15 and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in adults hospitalized with COVID-19.","95":"The specific objective is to rapidly establish a prospective cohort to characterize the factors related to viral transmission and disease severity in a large healthcare system in healthcare settings and HCW (healthcare worker) households. Investigators propose to address this hypothesis by recruiting and longitudinally following 500 HCW and 250 age- and sex-matched NHCW (Non-healthcare workers) within a large academic health system, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS). By intensively following participants over a six-month period and collecting serial biospecimens (nasopharyngeal\/throat swabs, blood, and saliva) and questionnaire data at nine time points, investigators can uniquely characterize Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and risk factors for Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) among health care workers and their families","96":"This project seeks to improve the effectiveness of a novel dissonance-based obesity prevention program that has reduced future BMI gain and overweight\/obesity onset by (a) experimentally testing whether implementing it in single- versus mixed-sex groups, which should increase dissonance-induction that contributes to weight gain prevention effects, and (b) experimentally testing whether adding food response and attention training, which theoretically reduces valuation of and attention for high-calorie foods, increases weight gain prevention effects. This randomized trial would be the first to experimentally manipulate these two factors in an effort to produce superior weight gain prevention effects. A brief effective obesity prevention program that can be easily, inexpensively, and broadly implemented to late adolescents at risk for excess weight gain, as has been the case with another dissonance-based prevention program, could markedly reduce the prevalence of obesity and associated morbidity and mortality.","97":"This is a randomized intervention study to test and develop the national curriculum of a parent intervention training targeting parent's ability for advocate for services to improve the transition to adulthood for their youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n\nUPDATE regarding COVID-19: The current intervention has been paused until it is safe to meet as a group again. We are still recruiting participants for cohort 2 (in TN and IL) and Cohort 1 and 2 (in WI), as the plan is to resume the intervention as soon as the situation allows and to keep the future scheduled interventions happening in the Fall of 2020, Fall of 2021 and Winter of 2022. For the baseline data collection visit, we have moved to remote data collection for all measures except the psychological testing with the youth - meaning that families will be able to partially complete baseline data via teleconference and\/or phone calls and online surveys. In-person visits to complete the psychological testing with the youth will be scheduled in the future when it is safe to meet face to face.","98":"Healthcare workers are at the frontline of the fight against COVID-19, and as such they are at high risk for infection and possibly for serious infection, linked to the extent of their exposure. The CROWN CORONATION trial prioritizes the protection of healthcare workers as a strategy to prevent collapse of healthcare services.","99":"This research will help us to learn if the medicine called metformin reduces the risk of death, heart attacks, and\/or strokes in patients who have pre-diabetes and heart or blood vessel problems.\n\nAs a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and after consultation with the appropriate research oversight, regulatory and monitoring entities, screening and enrollment has been placed on temporary administrative hold as of 3\/17\/2020. When such trial activities resume, the clinicaltrials.gov record will be updated accordingly.","100":"Most people with an eating disorder (ED) do not receive good treatment. The investigators have developed a new brief group treatment that is supposed to work by reducing how much women with an ED value the impossible thinness standard promoted by the media and how much they value\/crave binge foods. The investigators want to test whether the treatment actually changes those two mechanisms using brain scan data, which is more objective than completing questionnaires and even interviews.\n\nIn the first phase of the study (R61), the investigators will compare women in the treatment versus those on a wait-list. If the investigators can show that the treatment \"works\" (does what the investigators think it does) compared to no active treatment (women will be allowed to seek and receive outside help but investigators will not provide it until after the wait-list), investigators will conduct the second phase of study (R33),where they will randomly assign women with an ED to either the new treatment or to a group treatment that represents what many college mental health clinics provide to their clients with ED."},"enrollmentcount":{"0":"50000","1":"300","2":"1550","3":"5","4":"500","5":"152","6":"120","7":"80","8":"55","9":"350","10":"100000","11":"600","12":"2000","13":"346","14":"100","15":"50","16":"10","17":"100","18":"1450","19":"80","20":"1600","21":"50","22":"45","23":"400","24":"1000","25":"20","26":"900","27":"600","28":"230","29":"1000","30":"240","31":"90","32":"48","33":"2271","34":"40","35":"48","36":"390","37":"200","38":"600","39":"30","40":"120","41":"120","42":"260","43":"40","44":"30","45":"100","46":"3500","47":"138","48":"164","49":"15","50":"4000","51":"12","52":"200","53":"75","54":"20","55":"400","56":"500","57":"20","58":"30","59":"60","60":"10","61":"2000","62":"100","63":"25","64":"2000","65":"160","66":"350","67":"40","68":"200","69":"500","70":"6000","71":"10000000","72":"120","73":"200","74":"45","75":"210","76":"3000","77":"500","78":"144","79":"580","80":"500","81":"120","82":"200","83":"40","84":"700","85":"270","86":"108","87":"3000","88":"400","89":"6000","90":"1600","91":"330","92":"510","93":"250","94":"440","95":"750","96":"450","97":"180","98":"55000","99":"7868","100":"180"},"primaryoutcomedesc":{"0":"Prevalence COVID antibodies in employees of Beaumont Health","1":"COVID Ordinal Outcomes Scale at 14 days","2":"Hospitalization within 14 days of enrollment","3":"Change in Oxygen Saturation by Pulse Oximetry","4":"POCUS Score - Lungs","5":"Time to clinical worsening","6":"Metabolic and Nutritional Needs of COVID-19 Patients: Measured by Changes of Resting Energy expenditure(REE) over time, as measured by the indirect calorimetry Q-NRG device","7":"Improvement of clinical status","8":"For patients hospitalized for COVID-19 but not intubated","9":"i.
